          Shaastra is the annual technical festival of IIT Madras. Ever since
          its inception in the year 2000, Shaastra has been an integral part of
          the technical experience at IIT Madras. It has been growing in size,
          substance and stature and has become a trendsetter among college
          technical festivals across the country. Shaastra has the distinction
          of being the first student managed technical festival in the nation to
